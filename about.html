Students can post their concerns and get help from other users, they can also join communities and share their ideas. The main goal of this project is to fill the learning gap that synchronous classes cannot suffice and deepen the understanding of lessons through an environment that promotes lifelong learning. On the other hand, this platform also moderates how the users can use the web-based application for inappropriate usage with mutuals. The system will use ASP.Net C# as a language, HTML with CSS, and Bootstrap as software requirements. For the hardware, a laptop with 2.0 GHz CPU, 4 GB RAM, and Windows 10, or higher as the minimum specifications. By leveraging technology to address these persisting problems, institutions like Quezon City University can not only enhance operational efficiency but also serve the students with supplemental guidance QCians need.</span></p>
